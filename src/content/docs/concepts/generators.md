Status: current
Audience: generator users and package authors
Use when: you need to understand how generators turn contracts into app/runtime outputs.

Topogram core owns contracts. Generator packages own stack realization.

Before generation, Topogram validates topology, resolves the graph, builds
normalized contracts, and selects the generator bound to each runtime in
`topogram.project.json`.

## Runtime to generator

```json
{
  "id": "app_web",
  "kind": "web_surface",
  "projection": "proj_web_surface",
  "generator": {
    "id": "@topogram/generator-react-web",
    "version": "1",
    "package": "@topogram/generator-react-web"
  },
  "uses_api": "app_api",
  "port": 5173
}
```

The project must install package-backed generators before `check` or
`generate` can load them.

## Inspect

```bash
topogram generator list
topogram generator show @topogram/generator-react-web
topogram generator check ./generator-package
topogram generator policy check
```

Generator policy controls which package-backed generators may execute.

## Contracts by surface

- Web generators receive `ui-surface-contract` and related API contracts.
- API generators receive server/API contracts and optional database runtime
  context.
- Database generators receive DB contract and lifecycle plan.
- Native generators receive routed UI contracts and related API contracts.
