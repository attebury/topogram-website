# Topogram Model

> Topogram is a living app map that separates durable intent from stack realization.

Status: current
Audience: humans and agents learning Topogram concepts
Use when: you need the core model before editing specs, generators, extractors, or docs.

Topogram is a living app map. It keeps app intent, contracts, ownership,
runtime topology, rules, and proof in one validated workspace so humans and
agents can reason from bounded context before changing code.

The map can be authored directly, copied from a template, or extracted from a
brownfield app as reviewable candidates. Once validated, it can drive generated
outputs, maintained-app guidance, contracts, migration proposals, and agent
query packets.

## Source

`topo/` contains `.tg` statements and markdown documents. The parser flattens
the folder tree into one graph, so folders are a human and agent convention.
Start with `topogram init` when you want a maintained repo or empty `topo/`
workspace. `topogram init --adopt-sdlc` also adopts enforced SDLC. Use
`topogram copy` when you want to copy a starter template into a generated
project.

Common statement kinds:

- `actor`, `role`, `term`, `domain`
- `entity`, `shape`, `enum`
- `rule`, `capability`, `orchestration`, `verification`
- `widget`
- `journey`
- `projection`
- `decision`
- SDLC kinds: `pitch`, `requirement`, `acceptance_criterion`, `task`, `plan`,
  `bug`

## Project Config

`topogram.project.json` declares:

- workspace path, usually `./topo`;
- output ownership, generated or maintained;
- topology runtimes;
- generator bindings;
- runtime relationships such as `uses_api` and `uses_database`;
- ports and stack-specific runtime settings.

## Contracts And Surfaces

Projection `type` describes the contract or surface:

- `ui_contract` owns semantic UI: screens, regions, widget bindings, behavior,
  visibility, navigation, and design tokens.
- `web_surface`, `ios_surface`, and `android_surface` realize a UI contract for
  a concrete platform.
- `api_contract` owns API endpoints and wire contracts.
- `db_contract` owns database tables, columns, relations, indexes, and lifecycle
  intent.
- `cli_surface` owns command-line commands, options, effects, and examples.

## Journeys

`journey` records describe ordered workflows for users, maintainers, and agents.
They use repeated `step { ... }` and `alternate { ... }` blocks so the graph can
preserve sequence, branch points, commands, expected outcomes, and related
capabilities or surfaces.

Canonical journeys are graph-native `.tg` statements. Markdown journey text is
supporting material or an import/reconcile draft until it is reviewed and
promoted into a `journey` record.

## Runtimes

Topology runtimes are deployable or generated units:

- `web_surface`
- `api_service`
- `database`
- `ios_surface`
- `android_surface`

Runtimes bind projections to generators. Generators receive normalized
contracts and write stack-specific output.

## Ownership

Generated outputs can be replaced only when their generated sentinel is present.
Maintained outputs are never overwritten; Topogram can still emit contracts,
reports, checks, and migration proposals for maintained apps.
