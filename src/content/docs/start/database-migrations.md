# Database Migrations

> Use Topogram to plan and verify generated-owned or maintained database migration workflows.

Status: current
Audience: developers maintaining generated or maintained database schemas
Use when: you need database snapshot, migration plan, or SQL migration guidance.

Topogram treats database migration ownership as a runtime decision in
`topogram.project.json`. The `db` describes desired tables, columns,
relations, indexes, and lifecycle intent. The database runtime decides whether
Topogram owns generated migration output or only emits proposals for a
maintained app.

## Generated Runtimes

Use generated ownership when the database lifecycle belongs to the generated app
bundle.

```json
{
  "id": "main_db",
  "kind": "database",
  "surface": "proj_db",
  "migration": {
    "ownership": "generated",
    "tool": "sql",
    "statePath": "app/db/main_db/state",
    "apply": "script"
  }
}
```

In generated mode:

- `topogram generate` can write DB lifecycle files into the generated app.
- lifecycle scripts may apply supported additive SQL migrations.
- destructive or ambiguous migration plans stop for manual review.
- generated state snapshots record what the generated database is expected to
  match.

## Maintained Runtimes

Use maintained ownership when a brownfield or hand-maintained app owns its
schema files, migrations, and migration runner.

```json
{
  "id": "main_db",
  "kind": "database",
  "surface": "proj_db",
  "migration": {
    "ownership": "maintained",
    "tool": "prisma",
    "schemaPath": "apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma",
    "migrationsPath": "apps/api/prisma/migrations",
    "snapshotPath": "topo/state/db/main_db/current.snapshot.json",
    "apply": "never"
  }
}
```

In maintained mode, Topogram emits proposal artifacts only. It does not write to
the configured `schemaPath` or `migrationsPath`, and generated lifecycle scripts
do not apply migrations.

Typical commands:

```bash
topogram emit db-lifecycle-plan --surface proj_db --json
topogram emit db-schema-snapshot --surface proj_db --json
topogram emit db-migration-plan --surface proj_db --from-snapshot ./topo/state/db/main_db/current.snapshot.json --json
topogram emit sql-migration --surface proj_db --from-snapshot ./topo/state/db/main_db/current.snapshot.json --write --out-dir ./db-proposals/sql
topogram emit prisma-schema --surface proj_db --write --out-dir ./db-proposals/prisma
topogram emit drizzle-schema --surface proj_db --write --out-dir ./db-proposals/drizzle
topogram emit db-lifecycle-bundle --surface proj_db --write --out-dir ./db-proposals/lifecycle
```

`db-lifecycle-plan` includes `reviewWorkflow`. For maintained databases, that
section is the handoff checklist: migration tool, trusted current snapshot,
proposal commands, apply boundary, and manual steps for adapting the proposal
into Prisma, Drizzle, or SQL migrations.

Snapshot files passed to `--from-snapshot` are treated as untrusted filesystem
input. Topogram rejects unsafe JSON keys and malformed DB snapshot shapes before
building migration plans or SQL proposals.

The review loop is:

1. Edit `topo/` and run `topogram check`.
2. Emit the desired snapshot, migration plan, and tool-specific proposal.
3. Review the proposal against the maintained app's current schema and
   migrations.
4. Adapt accepted changes into the app's Prisma, Drizzle, or SQL migration
   workflow.
5. Update the trusted snapshot after the app migration has been reviewed and
   applied.

## Imported Maintained DB Seams

Brownfield extract/adopt can infer review-only migration seam candidates for Prisma,
Drizzle, and SQL projects:

```bash
topogram extract ./existing-app --out ./imported-topogram --from db
cd ./imported-topogram
topogram extract plan --json
```

Review:

- `candidateCounts.dbMaintainedSeams` in the import JSON output;
- `topo/candidates/app/db/candidates.json` under `maintained_seams`;
- `topo/candidates/app/db/report.md`;
- the `database` bundle in `topo/candidates/reconcile/**`.

Each candidate includes the inferred tool, schema path, migrations path,
snapshot path, confidence, evidence, missing decisions, and a
`proposed_runtime_migration` block plus manual next steps. Treat that block as
a proposal only. Extraction never patches `topogram.project.json` and never writes
to maintained Prisma, Drizzle, or SQL migration files.

When the candidate is correct, manually add a database runtime migration block
to `topogram.project.json` with `ownership: "maintained"` and `apply: "never"`.
If the candidate reports `missing_decisions`, resolve those first; for example,
a Prisma schema without a migrations directory should not be treated as a
complete migration seam.

The reviewed config target is the matching database runtime under
`topology.runtimes[].migration`, for example:

```json
{
  "id": "app_db",
  "kind": "database",
  "surface": "proj_db",
  "migration": {
    "ownership": "maintained",
    "tool": "prisma",
    "schemaPath": "prisma/schema.prisma",
    "migrationsPath": "prisma/migrations",
    "snapshotPath": "topo/state/db/app_db/current.snapshot.json",
    "apply": "never"
  }
}
```

## Tool Notes

SQL:

- Generated mode can apply supported SQL through generated lifecycle scripts.
- Maintained mode emits SQL proposals for the app's own runner.

Prisma:

- Topogram can emit a proposed `schema.prisma`.
- Maintained apps own `prisma/schema.prisma` and `prisma/migrations/**`.

Drizzle:

- Topogram can emit a proposed Drizzle schema module.
- Maintained apps own the Drizzle schema and Drizzle Kit migration directory.

See [Project Config](/reference/project-config/#database-migrations) for
the validation rules.
