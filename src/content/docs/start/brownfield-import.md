# Brownfield Extract/Adopt

> Extract reviewable Topogram candidates from an existing app, then adopt only what has been reviewed.

Status: current
Audience: developers and agents extracting specs from existing apps
Use when: you want to discover candidates from brownfield code and adopt reviewed Topogram source.

Use this workflow when an app already exists and you want a reviewable app map
before humans or agents change it.

Extract does not mutate the source app.

## Shortest useful path

```bash
topogram extract ./existing-app --out ./imported-topogram
cd ./imported-topogram
topogram extract plan
topogram adopt --list
topogram query extract-plan ./topo --json
topogram query single-agent-plan ./topo --mode extract-adopt --json
topogram check
```

That path gives you candidates, an adoption review surface, agent context, and a
validation gate before any canonical `topo/**` writes beyond extraction output.
For a beta readiness smoke, run the same path from a fresh npm-installed CLI
with at least one package-backed DB/API extractor.

## 1. Extract to a separate workspace

```bash
topogram extract ./existing-app --out ./imported-topogram
cd ./imported-topogram
```

Limit tracks when useful:

```bash
topogram extract ./existing-app --out ./imported-topogram --from db,api,ui
topogram extract ./existing-cli --out ./imported-topogram --from cli
```

Supported tracks are `db`, `api`, `ui`, `cli`, `workflows`, and
`verification`.

## Choose extractor packs before extraction

Topogram has two extractor sources:

- bundled extractors ship inside `@topogram/cli` and are always available;
- package-backed extractors are npm packages you install and opt into for a
  specific brownfield source.

Use bundled extractors for a first broad pass. Use `topogram extractor
recommend <source>` when you want Topogram to inspect local evidence and suggest
which first-party packages are worth installing before extraction:

```bash
topogram extractor recommend ./existing-app --from db,api,ui,cli
```

Recommendation is read-only: it does not load extractor adapter code, install
packages, write candidates, or mutate the source app. It only reports likely
bundled and package-backed extractors, evidence, and the next install, pin,
check, and extract commands.

Use package-backed extractor packs when you deliberately want extra
framework-specific discovery beyond the bundled pass. Package-backed extractors
are execution dependencies, not templates: they run only during `topogram
extract`, return review-only candidates, and do not own adoption.

Current first-party package-backed extractors:

| Source evidence | Extractor package | npm version on the current CLI line | Track | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Node package CLI code | `@topogram/extractor-node-cli` | `0.1.0` | `cli` | Commands, options, effects, and `cli_surface` candidates |
| React Router route trees | `@topogram/extractor-react-router` | `0.1.1` | `ui` | Screens, routes, non-resource flows, widgets, and UI stack evidence |
| Prisma schema and migrations | `@topogram/extractor-prisma-db` | `0.1.0` | `db` | Entity, enum, relation, index, and maintained DB seam candidates |
| Express routers and route modules | `@topogram/extractor-express-api` | `0.1.0` | `api` | Route, capability, parameter, auth, and stack evidence |
| Drizzle config, schema modules, migrations | `@topogram/extractor-drizzle-db` | `0.1.0` | `db` | Table, relation, index, and maintained DB seam candidates |

The policy pin uses the extractor manifest version, currently `@1`, not the npm
package version. Install the npm package version you want, then pin the manifest
identity that Topogram is allowed to execute.

`topogram extractor list`, `show`, `check`, and `policy status` report the
version split explicitly:

- manifest version: the adapter contract version pinned by policy, for example `1`;
- package version: the npm package version installed in your project, for example `0.1.1`;
- compatible CLI range: the `@topogram/cli` range declared by the package or inferred for first-party packages;
- policy pin state: whether the reviewed manifest version is pinned, unpinned, mismatched, blocked, or missing.

```bash
topogram extractor list
topogram extractor recommend ./existing-app --from db,api,ui,cli
topogram extractor show @topogram/extractor-prisma-db
topogram extractor check @topogram/extractor-prisma-db
topogram extractor policy init
topogram extractor policy pin @topogram/extractor-node-cli@1
topogram extractor policy pin @topogram/extractor-react-router@1
topogram extractor policy pin @topogram/extractor-prisma-db@1
topogram extractor policy pin @topogram/extractor-express-api@1
topogram extractor policy pin @topogram/extractor-drizzle-db@1
```

Install the packages you plan to execute. Topogram never installs extractor
packages during extraction:

```bash
npm install -D @topogram/extractor-node-cli
npm install -D @topogram/extractor-react-router
npm install -D @topogram/extractor-prisma-db
npm install -D @topogram/extractor-express-api
npm install -D @topogram/extractor-drizzle-db
```

`topogram extractor check <package>` loads the manifest and adapter, validates
the package shape, and runs a minimal smoke extraction against a synthetic
fixture. It proves the package boundary is executable; it does not prove that
the package understands your application. The real proof is the extract/adopt
review loop below.

Extractor command safety is intentionally staged:

| Command | Loads package code? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `topogram extractor list` | No | Discover bundled and first-party package extractors by track. |
| `topogram extractor show <package>` | No | Read purpose, install command, policy pin, and extract command. |
| `topogram extractor recommend <source>` | No | Inspect source evidence and suggest extractor packages plus next commands. |
| `topogram extractor policy ...` | No | Allow and pin reviewed extractor manifest versions. |
| `topogram extractor check <package>` | Yes | Smoke-test the adapter boundary against a synthetic fixture. |
| `topogram extract ... --extractor <package>` | Yes | Read brownfield source and write review-only candidates. |
| `topogram extract plan` / `topogram adopt --list` | No | Review package provenance, candidate counts, bundles, selectors, and safety notes. |
| `topogram adopt <selector> --dry-run` | No | Preview canonical `topo/**` writes. |
| `topogram adopt <selector> --write` | No | Write only reviewed canonical records. |

Then run extraction with the selected pack:

```bash
topogram extract ./existing-cli --out ./imported-topogram --from cli --extractor @topogram/extractor-node-cli
topogram extract ./react-router-app --out ./imported-topogram --from ui --extractor @topogram/extractor-react-router
topogram extract ./prisma-app --out ./imported-topogram --from db --extractor @topogram/extractor-prisma-db
topogram extract ./express-api --out ./imported-topogram --from api --extractor @topogram/extractor-express-api
topogram extract ./drizzle-app --out ./imported-topogram --from db --extractor @topogram/extractor-drizzle-db
```

Extractor packs return review-only candidates, findings, diagnostics, and
evidence. Topogram core still owns candidate persistence, provenance,
reconcile, adoption, and canonical `topo/**` writes. Extractors must not mutate
the source app, install packages, or perform network access. `topogram
extractor list` shows first-party packages even when they are not installed so
agents can select the right package, install it, pin it in policy, then run
extraction deliberately.

Private extractor packages work the same way. Keep the repo private, install it
explicitly in the consumer project, then pass the installed package name or a
local path:

```bash
npm install -D git+ssh://git@github.com/your-org/topogram-extractor-custom-api.git
topogram extractor check @your-org/topogram-extractor-custom-api
topogram extract ./existing-app --out ./imported-topogram --from api --extractor @your-org/topogram-extractor-custom-api
```

If you do not want package installation yet, use a local path:

```bash
topogram extractor check ../topogram-extractor-custom-api
topogram extract ./existing-app --out ./imported-topogram --from api --extractor ../topogram-extractor-custom-api
```

Policy still controls which manifest versions are allowed to execute. Public
npm publication is optional; deliberate installation and policy review are not.

## 2. Review extraction health

```bash
topogram extract check
topogram extract diff
topogram extract plan
topogram adopt --list
topogram query extract-plan ./topo --json
topogram query single-agent-plan ./topo --mode extract-adopt --json
topogram query multi-agent-plan ./topo --mode extract-adopt --json
topogram query work-packet ./topo --mode extract-adopt --lane adoption_operator --json
```

Agent rule: use the query packets before reading raw candidate JSON. The raw
files are useful when you need evidence details, but `extract-plan`,
`single-agent-plan`, and `work-packet` summarize extractor provenance, safety
notes, candidate counts, and the next review command in a smaller context.

Extract writes:

- `topo/candidates/app/**` for raw candidates;
- `topo/candidates/reconcile/**` for proposal bundles;
- `topogram.project.json` with maintained ownership;
- `.topogram-extract.json` with source hashes from extraction time.

Important JSON fields:

- `workspaceRoot`: the project-owned workspace folder, normally `topo/`;
- `candidateCounts`: counts by extracted surface such as `apiCapabilities`,
  `dbMaintainedSeams`, `uiFlows`, `uiWidgets`, `cliCommands`, and
  `cliSurfaces`;
- `extraction_context`: agent query packet context with extraction provenance,
  package-backed extractor summaries, candidate counts, safety notes, and next
  review commands;
- `nextCommands`: the next review commands Topogram recommends.

Extracted Topogram files are project-owned after creation. Edit candidates and
canonical files freely, but do not hand-edit extraction provenance or adoption
receipts.

DB extraction may also emit maintained migration seam candidates under
`topo/candidates/app/db/candidates.json` as `maintained_seams`. These are
review-only proposals inferred from Prisma, Drizzle, or SQL schema/migration
evidence. They are carried into `topogram extract plan` as a `database` review
bundle, but extraction does not edit `topogram.project.json`, schema files, or
migration files for you.

UI extraction may emit non-resource flow candidates under
`topo/candidates/app/ui/candidates.json` as `flows`. These are conservative,
review-only hints for auth, onboarding/wizard, settings/preferences,
dashboard/reporting, search/filter, and bulk-review routes. They include route
evidence, confidence, missing decisions, and proposed `ui_contract` additions.
Extract plan carries them as UI review packets; adoption writes only reviewed
reports/docs when you explicitly adopt the related selector.

Extract classifies evidence by source type. Runtime source and parser/config
files can create primary candidates. Docs, tests, fixtures, and generated
output can support review evidence, but they should not create high-confidence
API/UI/CLI candidates by themselves.

## 3. Adopt deliberately

Preview first:

```bash
topogram adopt bundle:task --dry-run
topogram adopt widgets --dry-run
topogram adopt bundle:cli --dry-run
topogram adopt cli --dry-run
```

Write only after review:

```bash
topogram adopt bundle:task --write
topogram adopt widgets --write
topogram adopt bundle:cli --write
topogram adopt cli --write
```

`bundle:task` is common for API/UI extraction. `widgets` promotes only widget
candidate files and their related event shapes. `bundle:cli` and `cli` are
common for CLI imports.

For DB seam candidates, review `bundle:database` and manually copy the proposed
runtime migration block into `topogram.project.json` only after confirming the
tool, schema path, migration path, snapshot path, and `apply: "never"` policy.
The DB seam packet includes the proposed `topology.runtimes[...].migration`
target and manual next steps; treat those as instructions, not automation.

Adoption appends receipts to `.topogram-adoptions.jsonl`. Use history to
audit them:

```bash
topogram extract status
topogram extract history --verify
```

## 4. Refresh when source changes

```bash
topogram extract diff
topogram extract refresh . --from ../existing-app --dry-run
topogram extract refresh . --from ../existing-app
topogram extract check
```

Refresh rewrites only candidate/reconcile artifacts and source provenance. It
does not overwrite adopted canonical `topo/**` files.

## 5. Choose the next operating mode

- Generate a new stack from the adopted Topogram.
- Treat the app as maintained and use Topogram to emit contracts, reports, and
  migration proposals while humans or agents edit app code directly.

## Existing app plus an existing Topogram

If you already have a Topogram you want to use inside an existing app, do not
use brownfield extract/adopt first. Initialize the app as maintained, then copy or
merge the reviewed `topo/` files:

```bash
cd ./existing-app
topogram init . --adopt-sdlc
topogram check --json
```

`topogram init` creates maintained ownership for `.`. After that, copy the pure
Topogram workspace into `topo/`, review `topogram.project.json`, run
`topogram check`, and use `topogram emit` for contracts, reports, and migration
proposals. `--adopt-sdlc` opts the repo into enforced SDLC linkage and scaffolds `topo/sdlc/`. Topogram
should not overwrite maintained app source.
