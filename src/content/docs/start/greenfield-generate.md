# Greenfield Generate

> Use this workflow when Topogram should realize an app map as generated app or runtime output.

Status: current
Audience: developers and agents creating generated apps
Use when: you want to start from a template or authored Topogram source and generate app/runtime outputs.

Use this workflow when Topogram should realize an app map as generated app or
runtime output. Generation is one Topogram workflow: the same `topo/` map can
also guide maintained code, emit contracts, and give agents focused context.

Start with [Init Workspace](/start/init-workspace/) instead when you
want an empty maintained Topogram workspace in an existing repo and do not want
to copy a starter template.

## 1. Create a project

```bash
npm install --save-dev @topogram/cli
npx topogram doctor
npx topogram template list
npx topogram copy hello-web ./my-app
cd ./my-app
npm install
```

`hello-web` is the default small web starter. Other catalog aliases can include
API, database, or native runtimes.

For a blank maintained workspace:

```bash
npx topogram init ./existing-or-empty-repo --adopt-sdlc
cd ./existing-or-empty-repo
topogram check --json
```

`init` writes `topo/` and `topogram.project.json` only. It does not copy a
template, install generators, or generate app code. `--adopt-sdlc` also writes
`topogram.sdlc-policy.json` with adopted/enforced defaults.

## 2. Inspect the project

```bash
npm run agent:brief
npm run onboard
npm run explain
npm run doctor
npm run source:status
npm run template:explain
npm run generator:policy:status
npm run generator:policy:check
npm run query:list
```

`source:status` may report no pure Topogram source provenance for projects
created from templates. For template-created projects, `template:explain`,
`template:status`, and trust commands are the relevant template lifecycle
surfaces.

Read:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `README.md`
3. `topogram.project.json`
4. `topo/**`

Use the Topogram Codex plugin/skill when it is installed. Without it,
`topogram agent brief --json` and focused query packets are the machine-readable
fallback, and `AGENTS.md` is local orientation only.

## 3. Edit the source

Edit `topo/**` for the model and `topogram.project.json` for topology,
ownership, ports, and generator bindings.

Do not treat `app/**` as durable source unless its output ownership is
maintained. Generated-owned outputs are replaceable.

## 4. Validate and generate

```bash
npm run onboard
npm run check
npm run generate
npm run verify
```

`npm run onboard` is the read-first adoption loop. It reports whether
check/audit/generate/verify are ready and recommends the next command without
writing or running anything. Use `npm run onboard -- --generate --run-verify`
when you deliberately want the loop to write generated-owned output and run the
detected project verification script.

`npm run verify` is the generated project's strongest standard verification
script. If a generated app exposes lower-level app scripts, they remain useful
for focused debugging:

```bash
npm run app:compile
npm run app:runtime
```

Bundled web generators claim `usable_app` output in
`generation-coverage.json`. That means generated screens must render
domain-specific screen copy, modeled empty states, form controls when the screen
is form-like, modeled action markers, and data-bound widget/display-field
markers. Generator provenance text belongs in reports and coverage files, not
inside runnable app screens.

## 5. Inspect contracts when needed

```bash
topogram emit ui-widget-contract ./topo --json
topogram emit widget-conformance-report ./topo --surface proj_web --json
topogram emit db-schema-snapshot ./topo --surface proj_db --json
```

`emit` is read-only by default. Add `--write --out-dir <dir>` when you want
artifact files.

## Loop

1. Edit `topo/**` or `topogram.project.json`.
2. Run `topogram onboard` to see the staged adoption plan.
3. Run focused widget/query/SDLC checks when relevant.
4. Run `topogram onboard --generate --run-verify`, or run `topogram generate`
   and the verification script separately when debugging.
